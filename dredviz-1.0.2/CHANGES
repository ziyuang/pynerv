1.0.2:

Bug fix: PCA now correctly returns the N *first* components, rather than the N last
components as previously. 

All code is now encapsulated in a namespace.

randomdatagenerator.hh now correctly #includes <ctime> rather than locale.h. 

1.0.0:

NeRV is now much faster than previously (O(n^2) instead of O(n^3)).

Added PCA: by default NeRV now uses PCA to initialize the projection (previously a random initialization was used, which may yield bad results for large or complicated data sets). PCA is implemented using the newmat library by Robert Davies (http://www.robertnz.net). Robert Davies places no restrictions on the use and distribution of newmat, so I have included it in the dredviz package.

Added 'klmeasure' and 'klrank' for computing smoothed precision/recall and rank-based smoothed precision recall. 

0.9.0:

Initial release.
